Research Interests
=======
- Data Mining/Rule Discovery: Sampling, Top-k, Diversified, etc.  
- Logic Deduction combined ML models: AI for DB, DB for AI, etc.
- Data Management: Error Detection, Data cleaning, etc.  
- Data Quality: Conflict resolution, Entity resolution, Tuple splitting, etc.  

My research interests include data quality, data management, rule discovery, and other areas of combining DB and AI. I have a strong interest in the intersection of DB and AI. I am particularly intrigued by how database techniques can enhance AI model performance, and vice versa. I expect to explore applying logic rules to make black-box ML models more interpretable and robust, collaborative optimization between logic rule discovery and specific downstream ML tasks, utilizing ML techniques to optimize various database management processes, etc.  

I am also open to exploring other research directions and enthusiastic about investigating new areas of interest.

Research Experiences
=======
My research primarily focuses on database and data quality, specifically on the discovery and application of data quality rules. My work has been published in top-tier database conferences, i.e., SIGMOD and ICDE. Below is a concise overview of my contributions across various domains.

* _Rule Discovery and Data Analysis_
    - I have tackled several challenges in rule discovery, including high computational costs and extensive resource consumption [SIGMOD22], the limitations of non-comprehensive rule
evaluation metrics that lack subjective criteria [SIGMOD23], and redundancy within mined rule sets [SIGMOD25].

* _Data Management and Data Quality_
    - I have developed methods for resolving conflicts within tuples of mismatched entities [SIGMOD24], and for graph entity resolution using graph keys [ICDE20].

* _DB combined AI_
    - I have integrated machine learning techniques with logic rules to enhance data quality. Specifically, I utilize machine learning techniques to accelerate the rule discovery process [SIGMOD22, SIGMOD23, SIGMOD25]. Additionally, rules discovered can be further applied to improve data quality, such as entity resolution, conflict resolution, and tuple splitting [SIGMOD24, ICDE20].
